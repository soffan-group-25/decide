# DECIDE

This is an assignment for the course [DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2480?l=en) that's given at KTH. The task is to create a program that decides whether to launch an anti-ballistic missile system based on radar data.

The program specification can be found [here](./decide.pdf) and the the Canvas assignment can be found [here](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/37918/assignments/235345).

The project is using the [canonical project structure](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html).

## Compiling and Running

### Requirements

In order to compile the program [`g++`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is required.

`clang-format` is used for formatting.

### Compiling

To compile the program run the `make` command with the target set to `decide`, i.e. `make decide` (or just `make`).

### Running

To run the program execute the `DECIDE` executable generated by `make decide`.

To test the program, run `make test`.
