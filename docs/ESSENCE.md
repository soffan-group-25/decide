# Essence - Way of Working

The states Principles Established and Foundations Established were reached at
our first meeting as we read the assignment requirements and decided on a plan
for which tools to use to solve the assignment. We decided on a GitHub PR-based
workflow, using C++ and a Makefile. We reached the In Use state (by definition)
once we started working on the DECIDE program in our GitHub repository. Since
then, we have been continually inspecting and adapting the tools we use.
Examples of changes since then are creating a merge request check list to make
sure we fulfill all requirements for commits to main, and introducing a "Merge
request" conversation channel in our Discord chat server. Since every team
member has adopted our current tools and practices, and are involved in
improving them, we are currently in the In Place state. The way of working
might not feel fully natural yet, but we anticipate reaching the Working Well
state some time during the next assignments.
