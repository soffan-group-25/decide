# Contributing

Open a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub for your contribution. Insert the below
checklist as the first comment on your PR. After creating the PR you are free
to continue adding commits before requesting a review or merge. The PR author
and reviewer(s) should check that all checklist items are taken care of before
merging the PR. Failing to follow this checklist could lead to not meeting our
project requirements.

- [ ] Each PR should add an atomic (as small as possible) bug fix or feature
- [ ] If your PR adds a feature or fix it also needs to add or modify at least one test
- [ ] Someone needs to review your PR before it is merged
- [ ] The merge method should be a squash merge
- [ ] You can continually draft your squash merge commit message by editing the PR title and description
- [ ] The squash merge commit title should follow our commit prefix convention of either "feat", "fix", "doc", "refactor"
- [ ] The squash merge commit should reference at least one issue
